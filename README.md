This is a project I'm using to practice DOM manipulation with Javascript. The goal is to create something between an Etch-A-Sketch and a sketchpad in the browser. Desired learning outcomes are to become more proficient with Javascript in general and working with the DOM.

The original idea for this project comes from The Odin Project's  https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project
